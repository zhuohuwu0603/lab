## ch1 What is deep learning?
* derive useful input representation that gets us closer to the expected outupt
* automatically find such transformation that turns data into more useful representation for a given task
* ML = searching for userful representation of some input data, within a predefined space of possibilities, using guidance from some feedback signal
* a network with minumum loss is one for which the outputs are as close as it can be to the target
